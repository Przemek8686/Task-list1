# Description:

A simple task list where, after entering a task, we can mark it as completed and also remove it from the list. In the form, after adding tasks, two additional buttons appear, thanks to which we can mark all tasks as completed with one click, and we can also hide them.In the navigation of the application, we can find a reference to information about the Author and an easy way to return to Tasks. There is also a search engine for filtering tasks on the main page.

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
